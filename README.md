# Web Component Factory

A factory that churns out web components, library agnostic with a unified development, testing, and build to production pipeline. We want to eliminate the barriers to web component adoption because as of Oct 23rd, 89.18% of all traffic can handle web components with *no polyfills*

## Install
```bash
$ npm install -g @wcfactory/cli
```
## Usage
Create a folder for the factory you are working on and run `wcfactory init` in this directory
```bash
$ mkdir some-directory && cd some-directory && wcfactory init
# add a new element (this needs work, npm run new is more functional currently)
$ wcfactory new
# or
$ npm run new
```
Answer the prompts for your new element and your off and running. To work on your new element called `new-name` perform the following:
```bash
$ cd elements/new-name
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
This will open the folder to the `elements/new-name/src` folder, start watching it for changes which will be compiled automatically (and documented), and open a mini-server (via `polymer serve`) which will allow you to edit the src directory files, compile them together and make them available for the localhost window for viewing.

## Build
The repo generated is managed by `lerna`. `lerna` allows you to manage multiple packages at once so that other people can take your individual elements you produce and use them as they please, while allowing you to develop everything in one repository. `lerna publish` will perform a build in each directory.

`npm run build` will perform the build step for the individual project. You may need to do this in order to get lerna to pick it up (we're still fleshing the workflow here out in the CLI).

In the future, Build will be in the CLI and support build targets (like make me a Drupal 8 base theme that references my built components for usage across browsers).

## Vision
- 1 command to get everything up and going
- Never have to understand the complexities of tooling
- CLI should seek to empower as many people as possible
- Anyone should be able to manage, create, and share elements in an element library
- Seamless sharing to webcomponents.org, npm, and git
- Unify CLI, build step, and element packaging across all libraries
- Allow advanced developers to fork, tinker, and repurpose to their will

## Goals
- Empower anyone that knows how to create HTML,CSS and basic JS with web components
- Eliminate barriers to entry by abstracting tooling
- Create a single dependency (docker) requirement to participating effectively in the future of the web
- Support any platform matching https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/ conformance testing
- Support any custom element sub class you want to add

## Features
- Monorepo management via Lerna
- Storybook for entire element catalogue
- Unified CLI that can create anything it finds a definition for in `./wcfLibraries/`
- All `example-element` would be worked on in `example-element/src`
- Gulp based dev routines + built in serve + compile to AMD, UMD, ES5 and ES6/native, per element for complete break away flexibility
- Data binding definitions mapped across element libraries (when applicable)
- Ability to add any customElement baseClass definition you want!
- Support for [HAX schematic wiring](http://haxtheweb.org/) as a single question!

## End user support
Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge (polyfill), IE 11 (polyfill); all of which are to be supported natively during the built in build routine. This should not be a configuration step for developers, it should just happen! As Edge supports it natively (probably by late 2019) it will just work anyway :)


## Development

### Yarn and Lerna

We use a combination of Yarn Workspaces and Lerna to manage local developement and publishing of this monorepo. [Read more about that ingeration(https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/#managing-dependencies-of-workspaces)

### Before Installing

Make sure you have a version of node >=6.0 and above.

Verify that you have yarn enabled â€” if not install yarn globally https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/.

```bash
yarn
```

### Install

Clone and install dependencies with yarn install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory.git
cd wcfactory
yarn install
```

Make the local version of the cli available globally.

```bash
cd packages/cli
yarn link
```

Verify that the cli is installed globally

```bash
wcfactory -h
```
